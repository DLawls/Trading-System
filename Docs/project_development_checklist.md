# ✅ Project Development Checklist – Event-Driven ML Trading System

A comprehensive step-by-step checklist to go from development to deployment and beyond.

---

## 🧰 Phase 0: Environment & Tooling Setup

- [x] Set up project folder structure (src/, data/, models/, etc.)
- [x] Initialize Git repository and GitHub remote
- [x] Configure Poetry for dependency management
- [x] Set up Dockerfile and docker-compose for local development
- [x] Define `.env` or secrets manager for Alpaca keys
- [x] Create logging configuration and base logger
- [x] Create base config file (`config.yaml` or `.toml`)

---

## 📥 Phase 1: Data Ingestion

- [x] Implement `MarketDataIngestor` for Alpaca OHLCV
- [x] Implement `NewsIngestor` (RSS or NewsAPI)
- [x] Implement `SentimentIngestor` (basic NLP sentiment pipeline)
- [x] Implement `EventScheduler` for earnings/macro/token unlocks
- [x] Schedule ingestion jobs (cron/APScheduler)
- [x] Log ingestion success/failure

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: Event Detection ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

- [x] Build rule-based or keyword-based `EventClassifier` ✅
- [x] Implement `ImpactScorer` with simple heuristics ✅
- [x] Develop `EntityLinker` using basic NER ✅
- [x] Save detected events in `EventStore` database ✅
- [x] Run historical detection on ingested news for backtest prep ✅

---

## ⚙️ Phase 3: Feature Engineering ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

- [x] Implement `TimeseriesFeatures` (SMA, volatility, volume) ✅
- [x] Implement `EventFeatures` (time-to-event, counts) ✅
- [x] Build `SentimentFeatures` (rolling, decay-weighted) ✅
- [x] Add `MarketContextFeatures` (macro, crypto-specific) ✅
- [x] Generate and store feature matrix ✅

---

## 🤖 Phase 4: ML Modeling ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

- [x] Define target label(s) (e.g. 1h forward return, binary jump) ✅
- [x] Implement `ModelTrainer` and train baseline model ✅
- [x] Save models to `ModelStore` with metadata ✅
- [x] Implement `ModelPredictor` for real-time inference ✅
- [x] Add `EnsembleManager` for model stacking/blending ✅

---

## 🎯 Phase 5: Signal Generation ✅ **100% COMPLETE**

- [x] Implement `SignalEvaluator` (thresholding/confidence) ✅
- [x] Build `PositionSizer` (volatility-adjusted) ✅
- [x] Implement `PortfolioAllocator` (diversification/risk rules) ✅
- [x] Define signal schema for downstream consumption ✅

---

## ⚡ Phase 6: Execution Engine (C++)

- [ ] Design C++ headers for `BrokerAdapter`, `OrderManager`, `Router`
- [ ] Implement Alpaca API adapter in C++ (REST + WebSocket)
- [ ] Expose C++ components to Python via `pybind11`
- [ ] Integrate with Python signal loop
- [ ] Add fallback/retry and latency logging

---

## 🔁 Phase 7: Backtesting & Evaluation

- [ ] Create `HistoricalEventSimulator` with replay logic
- [ ] Implement `PortfolioSimulator` to model fills and slippage
- [ ] Log PnL, Sharpe, drawdown using `MetricsLogger`
- [ ] Compare to baseline models/strategies

---

## 📊 Phase 8: Monitoring & Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up `Scheduler` for ingestion/training/deployment
- [ ] Implement rotating `Logger`
- [ ] Build `MonitoringDashboard` (e.g. Dash/Grafana)
- [ ] Create `AlertManager` for Slack/email notifications
- [ ] Dockerize the full system

---

## ☁️ Phase 9: Cloud Deployment (Optional)

- [ ] Choose platform (AWS ECS, GCP, etc.)
- [ ] Containerize all services
- [ ] Set up cloud logging + alerting
- [ ] Deploy using CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add auto-scaling or GPU support for models if needed

---

## 🧪 Phase 10: Live Testing & Iteration

- [ ] Paper trade with full pipeline end-to-end
- [ ] Validate performance and latency
- [ ] Iterate on models, features, and execution logic
- [ ] Transition to live mode (real capital)
- [ ] Continue backtesting and monitoring performance

---

## 📈 Post-Deployment

- [ ] Track performance daily/weekly/monthly
- [ ] Rotate models with new training data
- [ ] Add new event types and ingestion sources
- [ ] Run ablation studies and feature importance checks
- [ ] Implement capital reallocation rules

---

This checklist should guide the full lifecycle of the D-Laws Trading System, from idea to production.
