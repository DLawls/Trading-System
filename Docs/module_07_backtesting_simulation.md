# Module 07 â€“ Backtesting & Simulation

## Purpose
Evaluate trading strategies using historical data, events, and predictions. Simulates execution to estimate real-world performance.

---

## Responsibilities

- Replay historical events and market conditions
- Simulate trades using past predictions or hypothetical models
- Track PnL, drawdowns, win rate, and latency metrics

---

## Submodules

### 1. `HistoricalEventSimulator` (Python)
**Input:** Event + market history  
**Output:** Timed event stream

- Simulates event arrival (e.g., news, earnings)
- Can simulate lag/delay in ingestion
- Supports multiple timeframes (e.g., hourly, minute)

---

### 2. `PortfolioSimulator` (Python)
**Input:** Trade signals + historical prices  
**Output:** Simulated trade logs + portfolio state

- Models execution (fill price, slippage, partial fills)
- Tracks capital, positions, and fees
- Optional: multiple strategies in parallel

---

### 3. `MetricsLogger` (Python)
**Input:** Trade outcomes, PnL logs  
**Output:** Evaluation metrics

- Metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, alpha, beta, CAGR
- Trade-level stats: win rate, avg PnL, holding time
- Logs output in JSON, CSV, or SQL

---

## Output

Each simulation produces:
- Trade-by-trade logs
- Portfolio timeseries
- Summary statistics

---

## Next Steps

- Define benchmark strategies for comparison
- Implement core backtest loop
- Add market microstructure simulation (latency, spread, queue position)
