# Module 08 â€“ Infrastructure & Monitoring

## Purpose
Support the smooth operation, deployment, and reliability of the trading system. Provides observability and failure recovery.

---

## Responsibilities

- Schedule data pipelines and model updates
- Log key system activities and errors
- Monitor live trading performance
- Trigger alerts and recovery processes

---

## Submodules

### 1. `Scheduler` (Python)
**Purpose:** Trigger periodic jobs and event-driven processes

- Cron-based scheduling (e.g., via `cron`, `APScheduler`)
- Triggers for ingestion, retraining, and backtesting
- Event listeners (e.g., new tweet, earnings drop)

---

### 2. `Logger` (Python)
**Purpose:** Structured logging for diagnostics and auditing

- Logs actions with timestamps, module, and severity
- JSON log format (easy for parsing + ingestion)
- Rotating log files or cloud log sinks

---

### 3. `MonitoringDashboard` (Python/External)
**Tools:** Dash, Streamlit, Grafana, or similar

- Real-time trade monitoring
- System status dashboard (jobs, API pings, latency)
- Strategy metrics + PnL overview

---

### 4. `AlertManager` (Python)
**Purpose:** Alert operators on failures, opportunities, or anomalies

- Slack, email, SMS integrations
- Triggers on:
  - Job failures
  - Unusual latency
  - Missed trades
  - Outlier market moves

---

## Output

- Logs, alerts, and dashboards available during and after execution
- Historical logs saved for post-mortems
- Monitoring feeds used in CI/CD or automated response flows

---

## Next Steps

- Choose deployment environment (local, Docker, K8s)
- Implement real-time log aggregator (e.g., Loki, ELK)
- Set up basic web dashboard for strategy status
